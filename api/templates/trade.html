   <h2>Control</h2><br>
   <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Axumite was a thriving trade kingdom. They had control of a large section of the Red sea and they were at the intersection of a lot of trade routes which made them a great trading kingdom. They traded with kingdoms all the way from the Byzantine empire to China. They sold mainly Ivory and Gold, but they also traded many things including tortoise shells, rhinoceros horns, and emeralds.

  </p>
  <br><br><br>
  <h2>Partners</h2><br>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Axumite empire‚Äôs biggest trade partner was the Byzantine empire. Through trade with the Byzantine empire the Axumite empire was exposed to christianity. The empire became christianized around the fourth century C.E. . Ezana was the first Christian king of Axumite. Axum was the first African country to become christianized. That is how the Axumite empire was affected religiously by trade. 
</p>
<br><br><br>
<h2>Wealth</h2><br>
<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbspHaving such a great trading empire also helped the wealth and power of the Axumite empire. They were the first African country to mint their own coin in bronze, silver, and gold according to Roman regulations. Because the Axumite empire controlled a lot of the Red sea trade they had a powerful navy which helped them expand their empire. That is how trade helped the power and wealth of the Axumite empire.
</p>
<br><br><br>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Trade was very important to the Axumite. It was so important to the Axumite empire that losing trade was part of why the Axumite empire fell. When Arab muslims took over the Red and its trade Axumite lost a lot of its trade and without it the Axumite empire was unable to support itself and fell. That is how a lack of trade was important to the fall of the Axumite empire.
