   <center><h1>Ancient Axum Economy and Trade</h1></center>
   <br>

   <h2>Background</h2><br>
   <p>Ancient Axum was a civilization in Ethiopia that was known for its very successful empire, massive riches, and an exponentially increasing population during their golden age. <br><br>In Ancient Axumite, trading was a major source of income and immensely supported the economy. They thrived because of their strong bonds with other countries for the resources that the trade provided. Due to this process of trade, people from around the world were attracted to the empire. <br><br> This increased the empire‚Äôs importance as the population expanded rapidly, making it a prime spot for many to live and continue their career. 
  </p>
  <br><br><br>
  <h2>Buyers</h2><br>
  <p>The emppire had set up complex trading routes spanning across much of the middle east, including the Roman empire and India. Many resources were exchanged between countries via these trade routes, but the most common and important item traded was gold. This gold was used as a form of currency, and defined the majority of the wealth in Axum. This ‚ÄúGold (acquired from the southern territories under the kingdom's control or from war booty) and ivory (from Africa's interior) were Axum's main exports‚Äù (Cartwright). One of the Axum‚Äôs biggest gold recipients were ‚Äúthe Byzantines, [who] in particular, could not get enough‚Äù (Cartwright). 
</p>
<br><br><br>
<h2>Control</h2><br>
<p>
  Because ‚ÄúThe kingdom was at the crossroads of the three continents: Africa, Arabia and the Greco-Roman World, and was the most powerful state between the Eastern Roman Empire and Persia‚Äù (UNESCO) the ancient Axum empire had total control over the seaports on the Red sea. Having access to this was a key part in the overall wealth and success of the empire, but ‚ÄúAksum [only] continued to dominate the Red Sea coast until the end of the 9th century, exercising its influence from the shores of the Gulf of Aden to Zeila on the northern coast of Somaliland (modern Somalia and Djibouti)‚Äù (Metych). 
</p>
<br><br><br>
<h2>Colonies</h2>
<br>
<p>The Aksumite Kingdom grew through their trade networks and control of the Bab
el Mandeb river and Red Sea. There is a high chance that with their strong naval
power they also journeyed outside their borders and settled in places they traveled to
including India, Egypt, Italy, Greece, Kenya, Thailand and even some areas of
Indonesia. Oftentimes settlers will stay in the area and cause their influence to linger
throughout the area. The Akumitians often considered themselves an empire due to their multitude of
colonies around the world, but their influence of Axum did not directly influence the
smaller colonies.</p>
