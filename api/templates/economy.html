   <h2>Background</h2><br>
   <p>Ancient Axum was a civilization in Ethiopia that was known for its very successful empire, massive riches, and an exponentially increasing population during their golden age. <br><br>In Ancient Axumite, trading was a major source of income and immensely supported the economy. They thrived because of their strong bonds with other countries for the resources that the trade provided. Due to this process of trade, people from around the world were attracted to the empire. <br><br> This increased the empire‚Äôs importance as the population expanded rapidly, making it a prime spot for many to live and continue their career. 
  </p>
  <br><br><br>
  <h2>Buyers</h2><br>
  <p>The empire had set up complex trading routes spanning across much of the middle east, including the Roman empire and India. <br><br> Many resources were exchanged between countries via these trade routes, but the most common and important item traded was gold. This gold was used as a form of currency, and defined the majority of the wealth in Axum. This ‚ÄúGold (acquired from the southern territories under the kingdom's control or from war booty) and ivory (from Africa's interior) were Axum's main exports‚Äù (Cartwright). <br><br> One of the Axum‚Äôs biggest gold recipients were ‚Äúthe Byzantines, [who] in particular, could not get enough‚Äù (Cartwright). 
</p>
<br><br><br>
<h2>Control</h2><br>
<p>
  Because ‚ÄúThe kingdom was at the crossroads of the three continents: Africa, Arabia and the Greco-Roman World, and was the most powerful state between the Eastern Roman Empire and Persia‚Äù (UNESCO) the ancient Axum empire had total control over the seaports on the Red sea. <br><br> Having access to this was a key part in the overall wealth and success of the empire, but ‚ÄúAksum [only] continued to dominate the Red Sea coast until the end of the 9th century, exercising its influence from the shores of the Gulf of Aden to Zeila on the northern coast of Somaliland (modern Somalia and Djibouti)‚Äù (Metych). 
</p>
<br><br><br>
<h2>Bartering</h2>
<br>
<p>Not only was Aksum thriving in exportation, but they also were very experienced when it came to trading and bartering with others. <br><br> Many of their products were ‚Äúexchanged for goods brought by Arab merchants such as Egyptian and Indian textiles, swords and other weapons, iron, glass beads, bronze lamps, and glassware‚Äù (Cartwright). <br><br> The Axum empire was surrounded by resources, including stockpiles of weapons that they acquired via trading. Ultimately, this hoard of weapons and tools allowed them to grow and improve the quality and scale of their military. ‚ÄúDuring the 2nd and 3rd centuries CE its growth as a trading empire increasingly impinged on the power of the kingdom of Meroe, the fall of which was brought about in the 4th century by an Aksumite invasion‚Äù (Metych). The fall of the Meroe kingdom was heavily influenced by the Aksum and the continuous pressure they applied.
